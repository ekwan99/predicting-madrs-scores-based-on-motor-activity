Depression is a mental illness that leads to symptoms such as a lack of energy, feelings of sadness and emptiness, and loss of enthusiasm for everyday activities. It affects around 280 million people worldwide and is also the leading cause of suicide. Depression is often caused by or accompanied by sleeping problems, which can exacerbate one’s depressive state. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a ten-question questionnaire that produces a score out of 60 that allows the patient to assess the severity of their depression based on the given scale. The Depresjon Dataset (https://datasets.simula.no/depresjon/) contains data on 55 patients’ motor activity measured using an actigraph watch, MADRS scores, and more background information regarding the patients. Using features from the Depresjon dataset, we aim to ultimately create a machine learning model that can predict the severity of a given patient’s depression. Our study will explore various machine learning models to determine the most useful methodology to accurately measure the severity of depression based on their MADRS score.
